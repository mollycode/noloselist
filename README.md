==========

No Lose List is written in python with django on the backend and HTML with JavaScript, JQuery, and JQuery UI on the front end. Sqlite3 is used for the database.

All of the code was created within the 48 hour time period.

This program is the beginnings of a website that serves as a comprehensive list for all your needs. Ideally, I would like to have completed and implemented a lot more features including a log in, different types of lists, and progressively stronger alerts as deadlines approached. Although I wasn't able to fully design the front end as much as I would like, I think its simplicity and clarity is important for this sort of website. The focus needs to be on getting the information into the database and displaying the basics of what needs to be seen, instead of overwhelming the user with lots of images that distract from the purpose.
